The ActivityListController show is what is giving me the most trouble.  I need to be able to display a link "Cross It" if the user does not have any ratings for that activity.  However, I am running into a problem with using the grails if tags to display this.  The ideal way is to handle it with GORM in the backend controller performing some sort of outer join on the Rating table based on the User object, but I dont' know how to do this.  Currently I hacked it by trying to use those if tags.
As it exists now, the "Cross It" link will display only if no one has entered a rating for that activity.
For example, if Karen and I both go camping at Racoon Creek state park and neither of us enters a rating, then the "Cross It" link will display for me.  However, when I enter a rating, Karen will then lose the ability to show the "Cross It" link.  No rating will display (the g:if tags prevent my ratings from being shown), but she will have no way to cross the list either.
